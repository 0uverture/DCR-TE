	Workflow: $G=(V,E)$ \\
	Activities: $V=\{v_1,\ \dots, v_n\}$ \\ %missing event states
	Activity States: $S=\{s_1,\ \dots, s_n\}$, where $s_i \subseteq \{Executed, Pending, Included\}$\\
	Relation ($E$): $R=($condition, response, milestone, include, exclude$)$, $e=(v_x, v_y, r_i)$, $E=\{e_1,\ \dots, e_m\}$\\
	Actors: $P =\{$Alice ($A$), Bob ($B$)$\}$.\\
	History, $H_A(t)$, $H_B(t)$: Sequence of activity executions up to, and at time $t$, as perceived by $A$ and $B$, respectively.\\
	Execution: $(v_i, t, p_i)$, where $v_i$ is the activity executed at time $t$, executed by actor $p_i$.\\
	%History, $H(t)$: State of the entire workflow at time $t$

	What we want to achieve:
	\begin{description}
		%\item[Concurrency]: If $H_A(t_1) = H_B(t_1)$
		\item[Correctness]: Any DCR graph must 
		\item  
	\end{description}
	$H_A(t) \subset H_A(t+1)$
	No execution violates DCR rules
